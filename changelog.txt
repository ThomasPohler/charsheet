- Fixed issue where shield bonus was doubling up.

- Finished sidebar collapse feature.

- Replaced techniques with the most recent version.

- Changed "LETHAL" to "BRUTAL" in the attack section.

- Began organizing sidebar CSS rules.

- Restyled how the trait buttons looked when you have trait (dis)advantage.

- Gave light mode's styling some love. I had previously been neglecting it since I'm not sure if anyone is using light mode in Roll20 in our campaigns.

- Made the collapsed sidebar even thinner.

- Trait (dis)advantage is now visible as a tint in the respective trait button's background color.

- Fixed visual errors that would appear briefly when switching from light mode to dark mode.

- Added a horizontal line between the attacks and defensive actions. Previously, there was just a blank space.

- Built a new method of handling checkboxes that's more flexible.

- Made the sidebar collapse animations much smoother.

- Shrunk the title of the character sheet to better fit onto the top "line" of divs.

- The character box can now be collapsed to the top left.

- Fixed an issue where none of the text in the character box was readable in light mode.

- Fixed an issue where the collapsible parts of the character sheet would toggle their size each time the sheet was opened.

- Fixed an issue where the level-up tab was gone.

- Looked into an issue where Roll20 was stating that their was a security risk in my CSS and it would be "thrown out." This is false - it displays fine - so this appears to be a non-issue.

- The vertical lines will now expand as necessary to reach the top and bottom of their container.

- Experimented with a new method of rendering traits, but it looked worse.

- Continued refactoring how my CSS worked, particularly by beginning to include color variables.

- Updated how the sheet switches between pages.

- Fixed alignment issues when the traits were collapsed.

- Fixed an alignment issue when the character box was collapsed.

- Partially fixed an issue where the character box would visually snap rather than smoothly transition open.

- Fixed an issue where some of the new text would remain black in dark mode.

- Fixed a subsequent issue where the text on buttons was white.

- Fixed an issue where the button background colors would snap from one color to another instead of transitioning.

- Fixed some misc alignment issues with the left sidebar.

- Fixed an alignment issue with the input inside the smaller character box while it was expanded.

- Fixed an issue where the first click after opening the sheet on any of the collapse buttons wouldn't register.

- You can now shrink the loadout box. Further functionality, like being able to change loadouts while it's shrunk, will be added in the future.
